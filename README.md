# Address Plate Recognition and Delivery System using Drone <br><br>

This is a project that we made as our final project on Video Text Extraction. The object is to successfully extract text from address plates of people's houses from a drone's camera which would help in correct delivery of goods. The software implementation, i.e. the video text extraction part of the project is included here. <br>
